### About

A curated list of news sources and articles I occasionally explore.

### How it works

The application leverages the rss2json API to seamlessly convert RSS feeds into JSON format. 
Since I'm hosting it on GitHub Pages and currently lack access to server-side functionality, the app relies on this third-party API for its operation.

### Let's do it together.

The code is open source and I will be glad if you add something new and useful to it. Thank you !
